# Space Farm Management System

This project is designed to facilitate real-time monitoring and management of plant cultivation in laboratory environments. The system encompasses both frontend and backend components, with the frontend developed using React and Tailwind CSS, while the backend utilizes Spring Boot, MySQL, and Hibernate to ensure robust functionality and data management.

## Key Features:

### Cultivation Monitoring and Management
- Enable personnel to monitor ongoing cultivations and manage new experimental crops effectively.
- Store comprehensive information about each cultivation, including start date, type, plant species, cultivation station details, area, required conditions, and responsible personnel data.

### Historical Data Storage
- Maintain a repository of historical information for each cultivation, including harvest data (successful and unsuccessful) and cultivation parameters.

### Stage-based Cultivation
- Divide cultivations into stages (e.g., germination, flowering, fruiting) with detailed information for each stage, such as start dates and specific parameters.

### Multi-user and Multi-cultivation Support
- Allow multiple users to supervise cultivations, and enable each employee to oversee multiple cultivations simultaneously.
- Support cultivation of the same plant species under different conditions and at different stations.

### Reporting Functionality
- Generate insightful reports, including harvests collected within specified periods and detailed information for selected cultivations, including harvest dates, yields, area, and average parameter values.

### Secure Authentication and Authorization
- Implement secure user authentication and authorization mechanisms to ensure data privacy and integrity.

### Responsive Design
- Develop a responsive frontend interface to ensure seamless user experience across devices.
